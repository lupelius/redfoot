              We are two founders, Cem and Sed. We both have exactly the same
              story, needed to scale our software development teams, tried to
              work with many other off shore agencies, including Germany, UK,
              Turkey, Ukraine, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and most common
              problems were high costs, risk of losing product specific
              knowledge and lack of good CVs or poor levels of English and other
              soft skills.
